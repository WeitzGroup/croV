Code for: Quantitative infection dynamics of Cafeteria roenbergensis virus
=============================

In \[[1](#footnote1)\], we quantify life-history traits related to infection for the giant virus CroV by combining experimental results with theory. This repository contains the code used to estimate the parameters and present our findings.

This repository contains codes for

Recreating the figures in \[[1](#footnote1)\] (figure output in subdirectory: figures), and
all necessary subfunctions
Cleaned up data-sets in subdirectory: data.
Overall, function names are descriptive and the code is commented. The code was written and run in Matlab 2017b.
